Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Here are 3 tips for a simpler way to work.
01 | 	Edit and e-sign PDFs, all in one tool
Simplify the way you work and communicate through documents. Do it all — even collect e-signatures
— with just one tool.
Edit anything. Convert digital or paper docs to editable, searchable PDFs.
Fill and e-sign. Digitally fill out and sign any document.
Collect e-signatures. Quickly gather e-signatures and forms from anyone. No separate e-sign tool
needed.
Acrobat Pro subscribers can also use enhanced e-signature features to create web forms, add custom
branding, send for e-signatures in bulk, and collect payments, where applicable.
02 | 	Work from anywhere
Desktop, web, or mobile — it’s up to you. Access your documents and easy-to-use PDF and e-signature
tools from any device.

Use Acrobat tools within the apps you already use daily. Acrobat integrates seamlessly with Dropbox,
Box, Google Drive, Google Chrome, Microsoft 365, and more.
03 | 	Share files with others
Share files for viewing, commenting, or signing — across desktop, web, and mobile.
Share files fast. Click, add, and send. It’s that easy. And recipients can view on any device with no
software required.
Collaborate with ease. Send one email with one link to multiple reviewers. Access full collaboration
tools that work with your PDFs so you can easily leave comments, add @mentions, highlight, or search
a document.
Manage your files. You’re in control. Get real-time updates when comments have been added. You
can even send reminders and add deadlines.
